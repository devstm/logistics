# Express.js Server with Prisma - TDD Project

## Project Structure
- Express.js server with TypeScript

- Separate database configurations for each environment
- No mocking in integration tests - use real test database

## Database Strategy
- Development: Local PostgreSQL database
- Testing: Separate test database (automatically created/destroyed)
- Production: Production PostgreSQL database
