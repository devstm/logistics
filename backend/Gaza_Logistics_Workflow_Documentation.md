# üáµüá∏ Gaza Humanitarian Logistics API - Complete Workflow Documentation

## üìã Overview
This document provides complete end-to-end workflows for the Gaza Humanitarian Logistics system, covering all scenarios from driver onboarding to delivery reconciliation.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Structure
- **Tenant Isolation**: Each humanitarian organization operates in its own tenant space
- **Role-Based Access Control**: 5 distinct roles with specific permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all operations

### User Roles & Permissions

| Role | Permissions | Use Cases |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **DISPATCHER** | Create/view drivers & trucks, dispatch operations | Daily dispatch operations |
| **OPS_MANAGER** | Full CRUD access, approvals, statistics | Management oversight |
| **CONTRACTOR_FOCAL_POINT** | Manage own contractors' drivers/trucks | Contractor coordination |
| **MAINTENANCE** | View fleet, update maintenance status | Technical operations |
| **FINANCE_AUDIT** | Read-only access to all data, reports | Auditing & compliance |

```

#### 6.2 Audit Logging
All operations are automatically logged with:
- User ID and role
- Timestamp
- Action performed
- Resource affected
- Tenant context
- Additional metadata

## üö® Emergency Scenarios

### Emergency Response Workflow
1. **Rapid Deployment**: Skip normal approval delays for pre-approved emergency drivers
2. **Priority Routing**: Emergency status trucks get priority at gates
3. **Real-time Tracking**: Enhanced monitoring during emergency operations

### Maintenance Emergency
```http
PATCH /api/gaza/trucks/{truck-id}/status
{
  "status": "MAINTENANCE",
  "notes": "EMERGENCY: Engine failure - requires immediate mechanical support"
}
```

## üîê Security & Compliance

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in with credentials
2. System returns JWT token with tenant context
3. All subsequent requests include Bearer token
4. Token includes user role for authorization
5. Automatic tenant isolation enforced

### Role-Based Access Examples

```
**Solution**: Fix validation errors in request data

#### 404 Not Found
```json
{
  "message": "Resource not found"
}
```
**Solution**: Verify resource ID exists in current tenant

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Response Times**: API endpoint performance
- **Success Rates**: Operation completion rates
- **Active Missions**: Real-time operation count
- **Fleet Utilization**: Truck usage statistics
- **Driver Productivity**: Delivery completion metrics

### Monitoring Endpoints
```http
GET /health                    # Overall system health
GET /api/gaza/health          # Gaza API health
GET /api/gaza/drivers/stats   # Driver performance metrics
GET /api/gaza/trucks/stats    # Fleet performance metrics
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Import Postman Collection**: Use provided collection file
2. **Configure Environment**: Set up base URL and test credentials
3. **Test Authentication**: Verify login with different roles
4. **Execute Scenarios**: Run complete workflow scenarios
5. **Monitor Operations**: Track real-time metrics and logs
6. **Scale Operations**: Add more drivers, trucks, and missions as needed
