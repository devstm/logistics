## Database Changes Applied

```sql
-- Added DRIVER to UserRole enum
ALTER TYPE "UserRole" ADD VALUE 'DRIVER';

-- Added user_id column to drivers table
ALTER TABLE drivers ADD COLUMN user_id TEXT UNIQUE;
```

## API Endpoints Available

All endpoints require authentication and DRIVER role:

```
GET  /api/driver/assignment          - Get current assignment
GET  /api/driver/profile              - Get driver profile
POST /api/driver/truck/:id/status     - Update truck status
POST /api/driver/truck/:id/fuel       - Report fuel event
```

## Status Flow Implemented

```
IDLE → DISPATCHED → FUELING_REQUESTED → FUELED
  → HP1_WAIT → HP2_WAIT → LOADING_PREP → LOADED
  → EXITING → DELIVERED → RECONCILED
```

Branch paths:
- Direct to HP1 (skip fueling)
- HP1 to HP2 or HP1 to Loading (based on GL approval)
- Maintenance/Looted handling

## Security Features

✅ Authentication required (JWT)
✅ Role-based access control (DRIVER only)
✅ Truck ownership verification
✅ Status transition validation
✅ Full audit logging
✅ Tenant isolation

## Mobile Optimization

✅ Responsive design (mobile-first)
✅ Touch-friendly buttons
✅ Large click targets
✅ Clear visual hierarchy
✅ Real-time updates
✅ Minimal data usage

## Prompt Requirements Met

✅ Driver Intake & Approval
✅ Multi-Tenant Architecture
✅ Driver Role & Permissions
✅ Mobile-Friendly Dashboard
✅ Status Updates at Checkpoints
✅ Fuel Tracking
✅ Holding Points (HP1 → HP2)
✅ Loading & Delivery
✅ Audit Trail
✅ Security & Isolation
✅ State Machine Validation

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Create Driver User Account:**
   ```typescript
   // Create user with DRIVER role
   const driverUser = await prisma.user.create({
     data: {
       email: 'driver@example.com',
       password: hashedPassword,
       role: 'DRIVER',
       tenantId: 'tenant-id',
       name: 'Test Driver'
     }
   });

   // Link to driver record
   await prisma.driver.update({
     where: { id: 'driver-record-id' },
     data: { userId: driverUser.id }
   });
   ```

2. **Assign Driver to Truck:**
   ```typescript
   await prisma.truck.update({
     where: { id: 'truck-id' },
     data: {
       driverId: 'driver-record-id',
       missionId: 'mission-id',
       status: 'DISPATCHED'
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Login as Driver:**
   - Navigate to `/driver-dashboard`
   - See current assignment
   - Test status updates
   - Test fuel reporting

## Known Build Warnings

The following TypeScript errors exist in **pre-existing files** (not related to driver flow):
- `oauthRoutes.ts` - return statement warnings
- `truckService.ts` - type compatibility issues

These do not affect the driver flow functionality and can be fixed separately.

- ✅ Prisma client regenerated
- ✅ 7 new backend files created
- ✅ 4 frontend files updated/created
- ✅ Complete documentation provided
- ✅ All prompt requirements implemented
